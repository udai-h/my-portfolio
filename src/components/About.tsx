      <p className="text-navy dark:text-beige">
        I'm a software engineer studying Computer Science at The University of
        New South Wales.
      </p>
      <p className="text-navy dark:text-beige mb-4">
        My life goal is to create new value in the world through software
        development.
      </p>
      <p className="text-navy dark:text-beige mb-4">
        With an academic background in Human-Computer Interaction and
        Installation Art, I strive to build software that people can truly feel
        and interact with.
      </p>
      <p className="text-navy dark:text-beige mb-4">
        I'm especially interested in both web and mobile app development, and I
        aspire to contribute to services from both frontend and backend
        perspectives.
      </p>
      <p className="text-navy dark:text-beige">
        In addition, through my involvement in an international non-profit
        organization, I've developed strong communication and leadership skills,
        which I bring to both collaborative and cross-cultural projects.
